By exploiting the merits of both inorganic and organic photocatalysts, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a powerful way and bright prospect for developing novel materials for solar fuel productions due to the diverse choices of organic linkers and metal nodes as well as their flexible coordination modes.
