Along with the results from the previous experiments on the Co3O4 nanoparticles with average diameter of 8 and 4.3 nm, the variation of TN with the particle diameter, d, appears to follow the finite size scaling relation. The shift exponent is determined as λ=1.1±0.2 and the correlation length ξ0=2.8±0.3 nm.
