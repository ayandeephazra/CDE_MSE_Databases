The current experimentally derived bulk modulus of CrN is in a reasonable agreement with the DFT value of 245 GPa for anti-ferromagnetic CrN [36], 250 and 252 GPa for paramagnetic CrN, considering disordered local moment magnetic states on the cubic CrN lattice during DFT calculations, and our DFT calculations of 244 GPa (also for paramagnetic CrN) [17,19,37]
