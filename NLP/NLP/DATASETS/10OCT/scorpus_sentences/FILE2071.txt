The min-max normalization (or min-max rescaling) method was applied to rescale features in this work, and the feature candidate alloys were scaled to a predefined domain [a, b], according to Eq. (13):(13)x′=a+b−ax−minxmaxx−minxwhere a = 0.2, b = 0.8, x is the original feature, x′ is the normalized feature, and min x and max x are the minimum and maximum value of the original feature
