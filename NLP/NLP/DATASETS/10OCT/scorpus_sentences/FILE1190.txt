The medium-magnification atomic-resolution STEM image shows an overview of the CrN/AlN multilayer with a gradient in AlN-layer thickness, which increases from 1 nm to ∼10 nm while keeping the CrN layers constant at ∼4.0 nm (Fig. 1a) (an overview low-magnification image is shown in Fig. 1S of the Supplementary Material)
