When increasing the size (l), tempering time (t) lead to increased crystallization process and which increased modulus of elasticity (E), shear elasticity modulus (G) of the material and when the increase heating rate, temperature (T) lead to decrease crystallization process and which decrease modulus of elasticity (E), shear elasticity modulus (G)
