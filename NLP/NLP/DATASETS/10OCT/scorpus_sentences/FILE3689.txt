At high temperatures relevant to magmatic systems studied here, the reduced partition function is proportional to the bond strength (〈F〉 in N/m) and the inverse of the square of the temperature (T in K) (Bigeleisen and Mayer, 1947; Dauphas et al., 2012; Dauphas and Schauble, 2016; Schauble, 2004; Young et al., 2015),(1)1000lnβi/j=10001mj−1miħ28k2T2F with i, j two isotopes of masses m i, m j, ħ the reduced Plank constant, and k the Boltzmann's constant
