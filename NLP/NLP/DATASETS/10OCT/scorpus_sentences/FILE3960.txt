As per the present investigation, it is noted that the GGA-PBE measurement provides stability in all the rs and h phases of BaX, which is in contrary to the previous report in which h-BaO, h-BaS and h-BaSe compounds were identified as unstable at the DFT-LDA (local density approximation) computation
