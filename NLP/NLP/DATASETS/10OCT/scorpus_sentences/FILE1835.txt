It is supposed that a similar mechanism as described above, which involves significant rearrangement of Zr and O atoms plays an important role in the formation of metastable Cu2Zr4O phase (isostructural to metastable Ni2Zr4O) in Zr59.3Cu28.8Al10.4Nb1.5 (AMZ4) during devitrification from the amorphous phase
