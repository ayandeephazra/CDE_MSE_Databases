Comparing the bulk rock Ti isotopic compositions of the Kos rocks with those of other subduction related magmatic systems (i.e., Santorini, Monowai and Agung; Hoare et al., 2020 and Millet et al., 2016) reveals that the Kos samples classified as being the result of magma mixing processes have the lightest Î´49Ti values at their respective SiO2 concentrations (Fig. 6)
