The maximum compensation possible is applying a particle wall friction coefficient of 0 at the tip.•For industrial processes involving penetration of tools, such as bucket elevators, bucket reclaimers and grabs, the maximum applicable course graining scaling factors are limited by the dominant material equipment interaction.•The particle upscaling was succesfully demonstrated and confirmed for an industrial setting for both contact models; Hertz-Mindlin (no-slip) with rolling model C and with rolling of the particles restricted
