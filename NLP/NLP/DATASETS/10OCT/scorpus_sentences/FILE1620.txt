More importantly, at depths below about 4,127 m where no hydraulic fracture is detected, the mechanical brittleness index (BI mer) and BRMC4 show, however, relatively high values (high brittleness), whereas the new mineralogical brittleness index (BI bm) shows relatively low values (less brittle) indicating rightly limestone barrier
