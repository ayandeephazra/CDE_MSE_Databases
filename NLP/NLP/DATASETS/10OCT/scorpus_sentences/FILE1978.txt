Non-hydrostatic stress has no obvious effect on the Young's modulus- Yc (The Ya , Yb , and Yc used here to represent the Young's modulus in a , b , and c axis); however when the positive additional stress applied on a -axis, it would cause an increase in Ya and Yb ; and when negative additional stress applied on a -axis, it would cause a decrease in Ya and Yb
