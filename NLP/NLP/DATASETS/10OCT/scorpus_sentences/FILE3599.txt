More evolved rocks have heavier δ49Ti values that correlate with indices of magmatic differentiation like SiO2 concentration, and different magmatic fractionation series exhibit distinct slopes in δ49Ti vs. SiO2 (Aarons et al., 2020; Greber et al., 2017a; Deng et al., 2019; Hoare et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020)
