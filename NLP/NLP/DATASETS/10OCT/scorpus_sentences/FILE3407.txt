In saturated fine-grained or truly cohesive materials (i.e. materials that exhibit true physical cohesion, such as cemented sand or soft rock, not materials that exhibit apparent cohesion due to the local pore pressure regime or external stress state), driving high-displacement piles results in compression of the surrounding soil within 1D (Fig. 1 )
