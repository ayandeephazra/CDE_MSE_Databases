The Ti isotopic composition of the sample was then measured on a Neptune MC-ICP-MS at the University of Chicago (mineral separates) or the University of Bern (new bulk rock data), measuring simultaneously the Ti isotopes at masses 46, 47, 48, 49 and 50, as well as 44Ca for correction of the interferences from 46Ca and 48Ca on 46Ti and 48Ti, respectively
