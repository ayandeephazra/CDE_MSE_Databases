The present investigation aims i) to provide a physically sound basis to the estimation of T M through a “critical temperature” (T C), which signals the onset of thermodynamic instability due to a change of the isothermal bulk modulus from positive to negative at a given P C-V C-T C point, such that (∂P/∂V) VC,TC = -(∂2 F/∂V 2) VC,TC = 0; ii) to discuss the case of periclase (MgO), for which accurate melting temperature observations as a function of pressure are available
