However, the application of the self-weight of the unbalances and the pile leads to a penetration into the soil by approximately 1 cm prior to the vibratory driving in case of the Lagrangian simulation which results in a decreased density below the pile tip similar to the one in the CEL simulation.â€¢While the edges of the pile tip were slightly rounded in the Lagrangian model to allow for a smooth push of the soil to the side, the tip in the CEL model had, apart from a slightly blunted end of the tip, exactly the geometry as the pile in the model test
