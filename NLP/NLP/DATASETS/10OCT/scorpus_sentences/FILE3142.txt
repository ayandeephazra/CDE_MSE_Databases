When the compensation discussed in Section 4.2 is taken into account, this effect disappears and the predicted amount becomes independent on the selected particle scale - an independence which demonstrates that the adapted coarse graining technique can be used in large-scale grab simulations to save considerable amounts of computation effort without compromising the results
