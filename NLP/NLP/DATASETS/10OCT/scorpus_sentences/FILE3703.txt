Here, to estimate mineral-mineral Ti isotope fractionation factors, we calculate the force constants for Ti–O bond lengths of 1.81 Å (4-fold Ti, for olivine, quartz and plagioclase), 1.97 Å and 2.05 Å (range of suggested 6-fold Ti–O bond length, for magnetite and biotite) using the linear correlation between the force constants and inverse of the cube of Ti–O bond length from the DFT calculations of Wang et al. (2020), omitting the data using substitutions with Ti3+ (appendix Fig. A1)
