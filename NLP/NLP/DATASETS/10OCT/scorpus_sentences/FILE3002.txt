The tangential force F t′ in the coarse grained system computed using the same static friction coefficient μ s, as shown in Eq. (16).(16)Ft′=μsFn′=μss3Fn For the contact model with rolling motions, the rotational energy of the coarse grained system also needs to be comparable with the original system (Eq. (17))
