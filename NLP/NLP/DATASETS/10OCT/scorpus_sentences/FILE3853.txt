The fact that all the samples that plot on the fractional crystallization trend can be explained with a constant Δ49Ti between solid and melt of −0.20‰ suggests that the temperature has a negligible effect on the bulk Ti isotope fraction factor of the Kos magmatic suite (see also Hoare et al., 2020), despite the expectation that the magnitude of the Ti isotope fractionation between different minerals increases with decreasing temperature
