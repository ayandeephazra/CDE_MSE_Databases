In this sample however, Ti concentrations within individual magnetite grains are strongly heterogeneous (Fig. 1), meaning that magnetite either grew during different magmatic stages or crystals experienced Ti diffusion, both of which might have led to Ti isotopic fractionation between different minerals that does not reflect equilibrium
