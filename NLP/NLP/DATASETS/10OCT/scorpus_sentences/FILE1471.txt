The normalizations of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in Rickman et al. (2008) were not general expressions and were redefined as (Jin et al., 2015):(1)BImer=(En + v n)/2where the brittleness index is noted as BI mer, with the subscript “mer” referring to mechanical brittleness index calculated according to the equation originally proposed by Rickman et al. (2008); E n and v n are normalized Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, respectively, and are defined as(2)En=(E-Emin)/(Emax-Emin) (3)vn=(vmax-v)/(vmax-vmin)where E min and E max are the minimum and maximum dynamic Young's modulus for the investigated formation; v min and v max are dynamic minimum and maximum Poisson's ratio for the investigated formation, respectively
