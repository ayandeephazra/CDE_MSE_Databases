Thus, three prerequisites for forming BMGs are (1) a high mixing entropy, (2) a high average thermal conductivity, and (3) an appropriate negative mixing enthalpy, approximately equal to −28 kJ/mol (∂γ3∂Hmix=0).(21)Dmax−1F∝γ1=exp−6Smix/R (22)Dmax−2F∝γ2=K1exp−7Smix/R2 (23)Dmax−3F∝γ3=Smix/R3+K1Smix/R−78791+56Hmix+Hmix2+exp1917−1744Smix/R
One RF model, one LLS model based on symbolic regression, and 20 LLS models based on previously proposed GFA criteria were built on the CTT dataset without six outliers described in Section 3.2. The performance of these models was compared by a k-fold CV text
