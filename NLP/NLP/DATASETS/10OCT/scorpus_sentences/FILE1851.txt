The DSC scans shows that selective laser melting process causes some changes on the supercooled liquid region (SCLR) of the alloy, as seen by that the as-processed samples do not exhibit an end temperature for the glass transition region (Tg end), while a Tg end temperature can be distinguished in the DSC thermogram of the printing powder
