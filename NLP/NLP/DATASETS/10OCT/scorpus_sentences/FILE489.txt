With the whole picture of phase formation and micro-structure analysis at hand, the temperature range for the formation of dense orthorhombic MoAlB thin films becomes obvious: Between 550 and 600 Â°C, the highest density and hence the lowest amount of pores is observed (Figs. 6 and 5d-e), the films are phase pure (Fig. 1), and the crystal orientation is random (Figs. 1 and 2c and d)
