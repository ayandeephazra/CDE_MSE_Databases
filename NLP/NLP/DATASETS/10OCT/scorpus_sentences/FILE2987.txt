According to Bierwisch et al., the proposed scaling system does not affect the volume fraction, so the potential energy density of the scaled system is comparable to the original one.(2)ρp=ρp′ Consequently, the mass of the coarse grained particles is scaled according to Eq. (3), while the moment of inertia can be found using Eq. (4)
