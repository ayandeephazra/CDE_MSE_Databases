Massarsch (2005) used an impedance-based relationship to predict the maximum amplitude of soil particle motion at the pile-soil interface (z ̇max) where the shear velocity is minimum:(3)z ̇max=τfρVs∗where τ f is the shear strength of the soil, ρ is the density of the soil, and Vs∗ is the shear wave velocity in the soil with large strain
