To estimate interface energies, slabs composed of 3 N (111) rs planes (CrN or TiN) and 3 N (111) zb-AlN planes, for N = 3, 4, 5 and 6 were constructed and fully optimized (in the case of CrN, the lateral dimension corresponded to a 2 Ã— 2 conventional cubis cell and the magnetic spin up and spin down moments were distributed according to the SQS method) The resulting total energies, being dependent on the slab size N, were fitted withE=N*C1+C2where C1 is then the total energy of (bulk) 3 (111) layers of zb-AlN and 3 (111) layers or rs-CrN (or TiN), and C2 corresponds to 2*gamma*A, with gamma being the interface energy, An interface area and factor 2 comes from the applied periodic boundary conditions
