Additionally, the younger tissues with more negative osmotic potential at full turgor (Ψπ, sat), water potential at turgor loss point (Ψtlp), and lower the bulk modulus of elasticity (ε), the relative water deficit at turgor loss point (RWDtlp), apoplastic water fraction (AWF) and total hydraulic capacitance (C total ), which indicated that younger tissues have stronger turgor adjustment capacity compared to osmotic adjustment capacity and them were more easily lose water during times of decreased water potential because of higher cell wall elasticity and weaker water storage capacity
