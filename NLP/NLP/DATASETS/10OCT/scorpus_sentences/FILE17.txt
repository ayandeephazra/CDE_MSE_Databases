The techniques discussed range from common in-line methods such as near-infrared spectroscopy, acoustic emission and ultrasonic methods as well as techniques with potential to be more frequently applied in a pharmaceutical manufacturing line, i.e., terahertz spectroscopy and imaging, microwave technique, electrical tomography and X-ray based methods
