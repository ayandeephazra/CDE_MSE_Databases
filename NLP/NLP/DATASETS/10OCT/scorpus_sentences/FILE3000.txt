This confirms that the energy losses due to inelastic collisions are the same for the original and the coarse grained system.(15)cn′=256βm′∗=s1.5256βm∗=s1.5cn=ceq Normal contact forces acting on the particles in the coarse grained system are estimated to be s 3 times larger than in the original system [6]
