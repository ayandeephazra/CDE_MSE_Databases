Using all the experimental data obtained under atmospheric and high pressures, a complete set of parameters of the high-temperature third-order Birch Murnaghan equation of state was obtained: K 300,0 = 303(5) GPa, K′300,0 = 5.1(8), and (∂KT ,0/∂T) P = –0.017(1) GPa K−1, where K 0, K′0, and (∂K T,0/∂T) P are the isothermal bulk modulus, its pressure derivative, and its temperature derivative, respectively
