The films’ properties and performances were evaluated, and the experimental results showed that the KW-acrylate mulch films exhibited excellent sprayability, membrane formation, and mechanical properties, which allowed them to effectively reduce soil water evaporation (by 13–50%) and increase soil temperature (by 1.9–6.7%)
