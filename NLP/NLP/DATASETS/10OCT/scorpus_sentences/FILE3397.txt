The following equation predicts the maximum PWP induced at the pile-soil interface (Lo and Stermac, 1965; Roy et al., 1981):(1)Δum=1−K0+Δup′mσv0′where Δum is the maximum excess pore pressure, K 0 is the coefficient of lateral earth stress at rest, (Δu/p′)m is the maximum ratio of pore pressure generated to mean effective stress (p′) in an undrained triaxial compression test, and σv0′ is the in situ vertical effective stress
