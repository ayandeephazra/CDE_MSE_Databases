A new mineralogical brittleness index expressed as a function of weighting brittle minerals, can be written as:(5)BIbm = (CQ × W Q + CF × W F + CC × W C + CD × W D)/WT where the new mineralogical brittleness index is noted as BI bm, with the subscript “bm” referring to brittle minerals; CQ, CF, CC and CD are the weighting coefficient, in respect to shale brittleness, of quartz, feldspar, calcite and dolomite, respectively; W Q, W F, W C and W D are the weights of quartz, feldspar, calcite, and dolomite, respectively; and, W T is the total mineral weight
