While we cannot unambiguously decide between alternative models to explain the two trends seen in several chemical and isotopic diagrams (Figs. 4, 6 and A5), detailed examination of mineral compositions support the view that magma mixing was involved in samples KS-041 (andesite) and KS14‐05 (dacite) that both follow the gentler δ49Ti and Zr vs. SiO2 trend (Figs. 4 and 6)
