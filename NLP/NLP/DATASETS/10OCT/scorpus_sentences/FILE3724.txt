Furthermore, the δ49Ti difference between magnetite and neso/tectosilicates is smallest in the basalt (Δ49Ti = 0.426 ± 0.046‰) and largest in the two rhyolites (Δ49Ti = 1.082 ± 0.046‰), suggesting that the observed inter-mineral Ti isotope fractionation increases with decreasing temperature, which is in line with theoretical predictions (Fig. 7), bearing in mind that there may also be a control on degree of melt polymerization and Ti coordination (Farges and Brown, 1997)
