At equilibrium, the difference in the δ49Ti value between two phases A and B (expressed as Δ49Ti) at temperatures ≫ 300 K can thus be estimated with the following equation:(2)∆Ti49A−B=3815FA−FB/T2 As discussed by Young et al. (2015), the bond strength is expected to approximately scale as the inverse of the cube of interatomic distances; F∝1/ro3
