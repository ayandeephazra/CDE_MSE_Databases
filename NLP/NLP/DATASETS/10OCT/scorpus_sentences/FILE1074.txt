The modulus response is also non-normally distributed and most likely conforms to a gamma distribution with shape parameter between 1.5 and 2.5. The modal Young's modulus of all macerals increases with maturity, but not at the same rate, whereby the liptinite macerals become stiffer than the inertinites by the dry gas window (1.56 % Ro in Northumberland Coal)
