Using this model it can be shown that by tuning the Helmholtz resonators properly, the mass-air-mass resonance frequency of the unmodified double wall can be shifted significantly, leading to an improvement of the transmission loss of the double wall roughly between the mass-air-mass resonance frequency and the resonance frequency of the resonators
