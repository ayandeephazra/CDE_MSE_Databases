With the maximum scale factors the length scales of the particles remain much smaller than the length scales of the grab.â€¢The coarse graining technique resulted in a reduction of the duration of the iron ore pellet grab simulation of 55 times, while the performance and calibrated behaviour including penetration resistance remained constant
