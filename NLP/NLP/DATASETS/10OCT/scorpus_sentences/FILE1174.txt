To compare energies of zb-AlN and rs-AlN grown coherently (to MgO or to CrN), we have fixed the (001) in-plane lattice constants to a series of values from 4.00 to 4.40 AÌŠ, and for each in-plane lattice constant we have fully relaxed the out-of-plane one, i.e. to achieve a bi-axial (in-plane) stress condition
