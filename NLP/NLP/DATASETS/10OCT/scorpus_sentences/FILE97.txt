For the discretisation using the u-p formulation, Eq. (3) is substituted into Eq. (1) resulting in(4)φf1K ̅fṗf+divKPermηf-grad(pf)+ρ ̄fb-u ̈s+div(u̇s)=0.As mentioned earlier, the similarity between Eq. (4) and the energy balance for the simulation of thermal processes is utilized to incorporate the hydro-mechanically coupled analyses in Abaqus
