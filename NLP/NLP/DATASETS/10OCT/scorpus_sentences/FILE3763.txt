An issue with the isotope dilution method was the fact that, due to charging effects and the small mass of separated magnetite, it was not possible to weight the mass of magnetite of samples KS-082, KS-041, KS-022, KS14‐05 and KS14‐06 accurately; hence, we do not have isotope dilution Ti concentration data for these magnetite samples
