This argument is based on the observation that Ti-bearing oxides have a light Ti isotopic composition relative to co-existing melt and other minerals (Johnson et al., 2019; Mandl, 2019; Nie et al., 2021; Rzehak et al., 2021), which can be explained by the fact that Ti in silicate melts is present predominantly in 5-fold and only a minor amount in 4- and 6-fold coordination, while in Feâ€“Ti oxides, Ti exists exclusively in 6-fold coordination (Farges et al., 1996; Farges and Brown, 1997)
