An irreversible internal friction peak accompanied by a very small modulus relaxation (about 10%) are observed near the onset crystallization temperatures Tx in each resonance mode, and the peak values in these two modes are almost the same, indicating that the supercooled liquid region (SLR) is far from liquid state under high frequency vibration with micro strain (~10âˆ’7) amplitude
