In this paper, normal and tangential contact models as per Hertz Mindlin are used:(7)Fn=Fk,n+Fd,n=knδn32en+cnvn32knδn14 (8)Ft=Fk,t+Fd,t=ktδnδtet+ctvtktδn14 kn and k t are the normal and tangential stiffness coefficients and c n and c t are the normal and tangential damping coefficients as defined in Eqs. (9) and (10), while δ n and δ t are the normal and tangential overlaps and e n and e t the normal and tangential unit vectors.(9)kn=43E∗R∗andcn=−256βm∗ (10)kt=−8G∗R∗andct=−256βm∗ Fig. 3 shows the spring-damper system in normal direction of a group of original particles as well as the coarse grain with s = 2
