Using DFT, the calculated Bm by Fodil et al. is in the range of 192â€“197 GPa and 250 GPa for wz-AlN and rs-AlN [34], and by Wang et al. Bm is 194 GPa for wz-AlN and 251 GPa for rs-AlN [35], and Zhang et al. reported 194.84 GPa for wz-AlN, 205.57 GPa for zb-AlN and 247.55 GPa for rs-AlN, respectively [22]
