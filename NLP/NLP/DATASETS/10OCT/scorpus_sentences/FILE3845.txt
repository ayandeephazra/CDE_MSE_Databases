We assume that highly incompatible elements have a partition coefficient of 0, which simplifies the Rayleigh crystal fractionation equation to C/C 0 = F −1 (C and C 0 are the concentrations of a highly incompatible element in the sample and the most primitive melt; F is the melt fraction remaining), allowing us to estimate f Ti as,(4)fTi=TiTi0/F=Ti/CTi0/C0 We use Rb and K2O for our model, as both elements are highly incompatible and not strongly affected by late stage fluid exsolution (KD(Rb)fluid-melt and KD(K)fluid-melt are ~0.2; Audétat and Pettke, 2003), which is also corroborated by the trends in Harker diagrams of our data (Fig. 3, Table A1)
