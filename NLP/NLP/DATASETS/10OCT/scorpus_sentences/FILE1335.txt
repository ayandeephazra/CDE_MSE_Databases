Since coherent strain effects are even stronger in the TiN/AlN system, it allows us to draw a conclusion that the surface/interface energy terms play a crucial role in stabilizing zb-AlN, which seem to be acceptable for CrN/AlN multilayers (especially with a rather high O content of the CrN layers) but not for TiN/AlN multilayers
