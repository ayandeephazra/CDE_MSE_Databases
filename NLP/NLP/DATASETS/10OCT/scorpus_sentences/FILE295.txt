While in case of impact driven or jacked piles the zone of reduced stress is limited to a narrow strip alongside the pile shaft (accompanied by a sharp increase caused by the installation further away from the pile shaft, see e.g. (Jardine et al., 2013) for the experimental evidence of this phenomenon and (Staubach et al., 2020) for a numerical one), Fig. 13 does not show these high effective stress gradients close to the pile shaft
