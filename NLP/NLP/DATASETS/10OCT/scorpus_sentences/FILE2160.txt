The ML model applied to the SFS-6 subset (SFS6-D max) significantly overestimated the D max of Zr41Ti14Cu12.5Ni8C2Be22.5, which can be explained by the fact that it has a much lower D max than a similar composition of Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5. This also might be the reason for the underestimated D max of Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5. There were four Al-Co-Sc-Y alloys and three X36Y20Al24Co20 (X = Sc, Gd, Y) alloys in our dataset, and most of these had measured D max values <5 mm, except Y36Sc20Al24Co20
