Methods Model composites were formulated with dimethacrylate-based monomers, a photoinitiator/co-initiator system and silicon dioxide nano-sized fillers treated with different amounts of 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTS): 1.0 (G1%), 2.0 (G2%), 5.0 (G5%), 7.5 (G7.5%) and 10 (G10%) wt.% relative to SiO2
