The upscaled HM equations take into account the HM coupling in the dual matrix/fracture medium, comprising the cracks system as well as the intact porous matrix, yielding the equivalent stiffness tensor and two different sets of equivalent tensorial Biot coefficients Bij (I) and Bij (II) and moduli M(I) and M(II) for the upscaled system (I and II become identical only under certain hypotheses)
