Coarse graining of the penetration resulted in an increase of 16% in resistance on the tip of the blunt shaped penetration tool when the grain size was doubled.â€¢A compensation was succesfully applied by lowering the sliding friction of the penetrating tip for coarser grains, bringing the resistance back to normal levels
