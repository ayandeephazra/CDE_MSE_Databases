The estimated high fraction of Ti that is hosted in biotite (~40 to 50%) is likely one of the reasons for the similar δ49Ti of the analyzed bulk rocks and biotite mineral separates (Fig. 7) and it further implies that next to Fe–Ti oxides, biotite exerts an important control on the Ti isotopic fraction pattern of magmatic systems
