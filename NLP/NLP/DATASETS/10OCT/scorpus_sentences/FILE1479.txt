In Chinese shale gas industry, four brittle minerals, including quartz, feldspar, calcite, and dolomite, are generally taken for calculating the mineralogical brittleness index (GB/T 31484, 2015), and this index is called as BRMC4:(4)BRMC4 = (W Q + W F + W C + W D)/WT where W Q, W F, W C and W D are the weights of quartz, feldspar, calcite, and dolomite, respectively; and, W T is the total mineral weight
