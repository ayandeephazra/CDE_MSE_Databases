From the vibrational data obtained from Raman scattering measurements and ab initio calculations, the experimental and calculated pressure response of the YBO3 Raman modes is also determined with the corresponding GruÌˆneisen parameters and the symmetry of the experimental modes has been tentatively assigned and discussed
