Here, the transfer matrix is used to relate the sound pressures and normal acoustic particle velocities on the two faces of a unit layer extending from x = 0 to x = d e as in Fig. 5(a), i.e.,(3)P1V1x=0=TeP2V2x=de,where P i and V i are the complex pressures and complex normal acoustic particle velocities on the two faces of the effective medium, they are expresses as:(4)Pi=Ae−ikeffx+BeikeffxxVi=1ρeffc0Ae−ikeffx−Beikeffxx, The coefficients A and B are the amplitudes of acoustic waves
