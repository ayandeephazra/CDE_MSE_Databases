The results of electrical and elastic properties of these digital rocks indicate that the increase in abundance of the organic matter (OM) pores, intraparticle (intraP) pores, clay minerals, or OM results in a decrease in the electrical resistivity and elastic moduli when the pore systems of shale models are saturated with water
