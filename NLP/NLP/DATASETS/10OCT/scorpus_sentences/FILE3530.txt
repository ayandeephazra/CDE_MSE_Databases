Interestingly, if the change in PWP ratio is considered on a logarithmic scale (Fig. 11b), it is observed that PWP in the deeper test (below the depth of refusal) decreases to below the hydrostatic value while the PWP at the shallower depth (above the depth of refusal) appears to asymptote to a value larger than the hydrostatic stress
