For example, recent theoretical predictions on equilibrium inter-mineral Ti isotope fractionation factors based on density functional theory suggests that at 1000 °C the δ49Ti of olivine with Ti substituting Si in 4-fold coordinated tetrahedra is around +0.5‰ heavier than that of ilmenite (Leitzke et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020)
