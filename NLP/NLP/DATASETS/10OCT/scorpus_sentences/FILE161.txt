Since the computational effort running the simulation using this value for the critical time increment would exceed computational resources, and considering that a saturation of S=1 is unrealistic for the sand placement method applied in the model tests, an air inclusion of 5 % has been assumed, resulting in a degree of saturation of S=0.95
