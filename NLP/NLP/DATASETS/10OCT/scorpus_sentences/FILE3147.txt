This was confirmed in simulations of the angle of repose, where the shearing behaviour of coarse grains matched that of the original material model.•The material equipment interaction tested by means of two tool shapes showed that the resistance on the shaft is 3 − 5% of the tip resistance.•The sliding resistance on the shaft of the penetration tool is constant for the tested grain sizes and can be concluded to be scale invariant for quasi static sliding interactions
