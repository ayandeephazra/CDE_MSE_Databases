Major and trace elements were analyzed with different methods: (i) conventional XRF technique on Li2B4O7 glass (major element) and pressed powder (trace elements) pellets at ETHZ, (ii) trace element measurements with LA-ICP-MS on Li2B4O7 glass pellets employing the setup and techniques documented in Pettke et al. (2012) at the University of Bern, or (iii) major and trace element measurement by LA-ICP-MS on “Nanoparticulate Pressed Powder Pellets” following the protocol of Peters and Pettke (2017) at the University of Bern
