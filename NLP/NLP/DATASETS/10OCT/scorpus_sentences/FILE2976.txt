While the upscaling limit determined for the vertical velocity profile (2.5) were independent for the outlet opening to particle size ratios up to 21.7. The approach in this paper is different in that we calibrate and validate the DEM model explicitly with the aim to reduce computational cost of modelling >107 particles in a real scale industrial application where the equipment penetrates and excavates the bulk material
