The performance of the regression models was measured by the correlation coefficient r (19)r=∑i=1nyi^−y ̄2∑i=1nyi−y ̄2and the root mean square error (RMSE)(20)RMSE=∑i=1n1ny^i−yi2where yi^ is the prediction and y ̄ is the average of y i, and the r value lies between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit
