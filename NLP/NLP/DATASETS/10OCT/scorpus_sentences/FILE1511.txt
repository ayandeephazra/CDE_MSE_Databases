The test process consists of: (1) increasing axial pressure at a step of 10 MPa with an axial loading velocity of 0.05 MPa/s while the confining pressure is kept constant at 5 MPa; (2) stable flow rate of helium gas is measured with a flowmeter, at each step, with confining and axial pressures being kept constant for 0.2â€“0.5 h; (3) the test terminates until the specimen is failed; (4) during the whole test process, the axial pressure, the axial and lateral strains are recorded automatically through data acquisition and control system (Fig. 2a)
