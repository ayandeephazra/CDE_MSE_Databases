This can be done based on δ series = sδ n and the definition of k n in Eq. (9):(11)keq=s2kseries=s214Fkδseries1.5=s214Fksδn1.5=s2Fk,series/δn1.5s1.5=s2kns1.5=skn When the same equivalent Young's modulus is maintained for the coarse system (Eq. (12)),(12)E′∗=E∗the stiffness of the coarse system k n′ in Eq. (13) is equal to the equivalent stiffness of the original system k eq. For the tangential stiffness k t, the same scaling factor can be acquired
