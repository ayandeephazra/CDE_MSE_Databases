Thermodynamic parameters reflect the driving force for glass transformation, and these parameters (which are defined in the equations below) include the mixing enthalpy (H mix) based on Miedema's empirical method [43] (Eq. (5)), the normalized mixing entropy (S mix/R), based on fundamental thermodynamics [44] (Eq. (6)), the normalized mismatch entropy (S mis/k B), estimated via a relationship given by Takeuchi et al. [12] (Eq. (7)), as well as two parameters denoted PHS mis (Eq. (8)) and PHSS (Eq. (10)) proposed by Rao et al. [45], and a similar self-defined parameter PHS mix (Eq. (9)):(5)Hmix=4∑j=iN∑i=1N∆Hijaiaj (6)Smix/R=−∑i=1Nailnai (7)Smis/kB≅Rmd2/21.92 (8)PHSmis=Hmix·Smis/kB (9)PHSmix=Hmix·Smix/R (10)PHSS=Hmix·Smis/kB·Smix/R,where ΔH ij is the molar mixing enthalpy for binary liquid alloys [12], R is the gas constant, k B is the Boltzmann constant, R m d is the discrepancy of R m calculated with Eq.
