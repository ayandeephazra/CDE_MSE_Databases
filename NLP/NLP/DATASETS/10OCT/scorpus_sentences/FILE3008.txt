The resulting angular velocity of the coarse grain satisfies Eq. (17), confirming that the coarse grain has the same rotational energy as the group of original particles and consequently that similarity between the original system and the coarse grain one has been achieved.(18)θ ̈′=T′I′=Ft'R′+μrFn'R′I′=s3FtsR+μrs3FnsRs5I=1sθ ̈ This shows that the coarse grain system has the same energy components as the original one
