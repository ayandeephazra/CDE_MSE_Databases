It turns out that apart from a small compositional region with N-rich compositions (N/(N+Al)∼0.53–0.55, i.e., N:Al = 1:0.9–1:0.8), the wurtzite phase is always energetically preferred, and becomes stabilized with an increasing amount of vacancies (either Al or N, the latter in the case of N/(N+Al)<0.50)
