Together with low syneresis gelling mechanism proposal, the static and dynamic properties of the formulated gel were evaluated in terms of bulk gel stability, gelation time, and gel strength, on the effect of polymer and crosslinker concentration, salinity, temperature, storage and loss modulus and plugging rate
