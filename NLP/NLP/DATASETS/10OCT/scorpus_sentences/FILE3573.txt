In order to evaluate effect of different substitution concentration and configuration on desorption temperature and bulk modulus, we constructed five systems such as Mg4Ti2H12, Mg8Ti2H20, Mg16Ti2H36, Mg14Ti4H36 and Mg12Ti6H36 by using 1 × 1 × 3, 1 × 1 × 5 and 3 × 3 × 1 super cell of pure magnesium hydride
