The newly revised model carries several novel concepts: using a strain increment dependent flow rule and loading/unloading criterion that results in explicit integrations of stress-strain model equations; the density dependency extended to more ingredients of the model structure, especially to plastic shear and bulk moduli that achieves ‘one set of model parameters for one sand’ for cyclic loading responses; and the appropriate use of three intrinsic history dependent variables, i.e., the latest stress reversal point, the virgin loading (i.e. maximum pre-stress) stress ratio, and the accumulated plastic deviatoric strains that contribute greatly to the enhanced capabilities of the revised model
