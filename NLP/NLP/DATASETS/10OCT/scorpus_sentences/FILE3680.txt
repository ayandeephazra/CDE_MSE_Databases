Spot analyses were measured at 10 nA beam current using a beam diameter of 3 Î¼m and were calibrated using the CITZAF procedure and the following natural and synthetic standards: albite (Na2O), anorthite (CaO, Al2O3), forsterite (MgO), magnetite (FeO), Ni-metal (NiO), orthoclase (SiO2, K2O), spinel (Cr2O3), rutile (TiO2)
