Here, we present Ti isotope data of mineral separates (magnetite, olivine, biotite, plagioclase and quartz) from six volcanic rocks (1 basalt, 1 andesite, 2 dacites and 2 rhyolites) of the Kos magmatic suite, with the aim of better characterizing inter-mineral Ti isotope fractionation in a calc-alkaline differentiation series
