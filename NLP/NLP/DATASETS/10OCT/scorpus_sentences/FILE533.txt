This paper addresses this gap and presents the nanomechanical measurements performed on the corroded cast iron specimens and the maximum degradation was quantified.Specimensafter 545 days of burial in corrosive soil conditions were tested by nanoindentation for determining the degradation of their nanomechanical properties
