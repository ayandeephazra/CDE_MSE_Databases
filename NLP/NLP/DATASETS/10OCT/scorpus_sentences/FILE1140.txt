Prior to the deposition, the polished MgO (100) substrate (10 × 10 × 0.5 mm3) were ultrasonically pre-cleaned in acetone and ethanol for 5 min each, thermally cleaned at 500 °C for 20 min inside the evacuated deposition chamber (base pressure at room temperature was ∼5 × 10−4 Pa), and Ar-ion etched for 10 min at the same temperature in an Ar atmosphere at a pressure of 6 Pa by applying a constant bias voltage of −750 V to the substrate
