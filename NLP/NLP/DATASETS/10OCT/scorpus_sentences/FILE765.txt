The nanohardness values are 10â€“30 % higher than those of Vickers microhardness measured at 9.8 N, which is reasonable due to the indentation size effect [52] at different indentation loads as well as the different Oliver and Pharr method [53] adopted for nanoindentation hardness analysis (that utilizes projected contact area at peak load, instead of the residual projected area, and assumes purely elastic contact)
