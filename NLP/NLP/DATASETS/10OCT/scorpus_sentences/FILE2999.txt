The damping of each series of springs c series can be determined based on the definition of c n in Eq. (9), δ series = sδ n and the scaling factors for v n (Eq. (5)) and k n (Eq. (13)).(14)ceq=s2cseries=s214Fdvserieskseriesδseries1.5=s214Fdvnkns1.5sδn1.5=s214Fdsvnknδn1.5=s2Fd,series/vnknδn1.5s=s2cns=s1.5cn Eq. (15) then shows that the damping coefficient c n′ of the coarse grain is identical to the equivalent damping c eq. For the tangential damping c t, the same scaling factor can be calculated
