The geometric structure of the fracture set around the "Excavation Damage Zone" of the GMR gallery is described by a hybrid model comprising: (i) a set of 10 000 fissures with radially inhomogeneous statistics (size, thickness and density increasing towards the wall) and; (ii) a deterministic set of large curved fractures, periodically spaced along the axis of the gallery according to a 3D chevron pattern
