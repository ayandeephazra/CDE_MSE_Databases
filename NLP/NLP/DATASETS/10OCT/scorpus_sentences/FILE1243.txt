This is a first direct attempt to experimentally map mechanical properties at the nanometer scale (Note: considering the delocalization of the scattering, in the present case, there are delocalization amounts to 1â€“2 nm for plasmon losses according to the analysis [26], which degrades the spatial resolution), which, however, is difficult to achieve (with this resolution) using nanoindentation or other established methods
