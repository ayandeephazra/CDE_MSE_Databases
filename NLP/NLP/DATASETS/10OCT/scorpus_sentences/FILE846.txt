Objectives Using standardized aluminum tooth models, this study: 1) measured the deflection along the cusp wall of models with a Class II cavity restored using either bulk filling or horizontal incremental filling techniques, and 2) calculated the cusp deflection and built-in stress within the restored tooth models for both filling techniques using a finite element (FE) model
