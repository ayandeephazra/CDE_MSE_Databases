These values are substantially higher than those measured in the region away from the substrate, where the average value is 0.80 ± 0.44 at%; 2) the O content is much higher in the very first CrN layer (close to the free surface of the substrate), and then decreases in the second CrN layer, and almost approaches the lowest level in the third CrN layer at a distance of ∼ 10 nm from substrate
