In FBS, the lubrication responses were pushed towards elasto-hydrodynamics with nearly all friction coefficient values falling below 0.3. This indicates that the FBS interacts with the hydrogels and cartilage samples in a similar manner as that of cartilage by maintaining a robust layer of solution at the interface during sliding
