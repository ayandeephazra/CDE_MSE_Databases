By inverting Eq. (7), we obtain the acoustic impedance Z and the refractive index n,(8)Z=r1−2⋅R+R2−T2,n=−j⋅logxk⋅d, (9)r=±R2−T2−12−4⋅T2,x=1−R2+T2+r2⋅T, The ρ eff relative to the background air can be obtained from above n and Z [61].(10)ρeff=Z⋅n/ρ0 Fig. 7(b)–(d) represents the retrieved and imaginary parts of ρ eff
