The alloy feature candidates were calculated from the corresponding elemental properties (shown in Table 1 ) based on the linear mixture rule (x 1) [40] and the reciprocal mixture rule (x 2) [41], and their deviation (xD) [42] and discrepancy (xd) were also calculated [42], with Eqs. (1)–(4).(1)x1=∑i=1Naixi (2)x2=∑i=1Naixi−1 (3)xD=∑i=1Naixi−x12 (4)xd=∑i=1Nai1−xi/x12,where a i and x i are the atomic fraction and elemental properties of the i-th constituent, respectively
