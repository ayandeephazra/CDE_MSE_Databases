The design problem is then formulated to make the micro-lattice have a large but realistically attainable ratio of effective bulk modulus compared to the shear modulus, corresponding to the isotropic microstructure with the effective Poissonâ€™s ratio close to 0.5. The larger of the ratio, the better of the PMM solids to simulate liquids
