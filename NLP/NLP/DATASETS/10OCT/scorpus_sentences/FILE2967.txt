For example, Baars [4] writes that the average grain size only matters on the micro scale and “has absolutely no influence on the macro behaviour”, while Achmus and Abdel-Rahman [1] state that “a remarkable scale effect exists” and that “the parameters of the model have to be adapted by means of a new calibration procedure if the scaling factor is changed.” Coarse graining techniques were applied to industrial applications of modelling material flow through transfer chutes by Xie et al. [28], for hopper discharge processes by Grima [13], for pneumatic conveying systems by Sakai and Koshizuka [24] and industrial gas solid flows by Mori et al. [21] accounting for particle fluid interaction
