The homogenous elemental distributions of metal cations in specimen HEHB1 and HEHB3 are confirmed by both microscale SEM-EDS elemental maps and nanoscale STEM-EDS elemental maps (Fig. 3 ), whereas the elemental homogeneities of other specimens at microscale can be verified by the SEM-EDS elemental maps in Supplementary Fig. S4
