Several interesting observations may be obtained:(1)Attempts to drive the closed-ended pile B2P2 resulted in generation of significant negative PWPs at shallow vibrating wire transducers (VWTs), particularly at the depth of the pile toe;(2)As open-ended B2P1 and B2P2 were advanced through the diatomaceous stratum, negative PWPs developed in the upper VWTs while positive PWPs developed in the deeper VWTs;(3)Very large positive PWPs developed at all VWTs during driving of B2P3
