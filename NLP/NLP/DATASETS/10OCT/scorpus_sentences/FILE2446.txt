AMs analogue to electromagnetic metamaterials have already been investigated in recent works, such as negative effective parameters [1,2], negative refractive index or near-zero-index [3,4], energy absorption [5,6], absorber [7â€“9], acoustic cloaking [10,11], acoustic superlens [12,13] and topologically protected one-way propagation [14]
