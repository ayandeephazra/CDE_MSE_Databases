In the brine saturated sample, for a 4 MPa deviatoric stress increase, there was about 89% increase in primary fatigue rate with up to 16% more strain, up to 88% reduction in fatigue rate when fatigue goes from primary to secondary fatigue and a reduction in primary fatigue duration by 39% with a bulk modulus of 1.050 GPa
