In order to evaluate the influence of pile-soil interface friction on the change of the soil state during the driving process, an additional simulation using a friction coefficient of μ=0.2 (setting μ=0.1 and assuming that the ratio between total and effective stress is two as explained in Section 4.1) is performed
