One simulation has been performed with a frictionless contact between the pile and the soil, considering the limitation that total effective normal contact stresses are used to calculate the transmittable shear stresses, as already discussed in Section 4.1. As will be shown in the following, the vibratory driving leads to a strong reduction of effective stress around the pile shaft resulting in a corresponding loss of shear resistance
