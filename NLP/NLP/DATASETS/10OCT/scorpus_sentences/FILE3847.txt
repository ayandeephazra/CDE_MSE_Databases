Assuming that andesite and dacite samples Kos2E, KS-041, KS14‐05, and KS14‐10 define a separate magmatic fractionation series (rather than being the product of magma mixing, the interpretation we favor), the δ49Ti values can be explained with an α solid−melt of ~0.99993 (Δ49Tisolid−melt= −0.07‰; Fig. 6)
