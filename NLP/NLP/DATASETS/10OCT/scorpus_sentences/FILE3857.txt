We therefore confirm the theoretical expectations and previous observations that Fe–Ti oxides preferentially incorporate light Ti isotopes, and are thus one of the key players to explain the observed δ49Ti variations in the global igneous rock record (Aarons et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2019; Millet et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2020)
