Nie et al. (2021) measured an offset between biotite and ilmenite of  around +0.38‰ in a metapelite from Moosilauke equilibrated at ~500 °C, and Mandl (2019) obtained a difference of around +0.24‰ between biotite and magnetite from the Kneeling Nun Tuff at an inferred equilibration temperature of ~700 °C
