Here, the first zb-AlN grows on the first CrN layer which is strained to the MgO substrate (lattice parameters of CrN and MgO are 4.14 Å and 4.24 Å, respectively [23,24], yielding a lattice mismatch δ = 2.3%; interface between the first CrN and the substrate shows only very few misfit dislocations), and those unrelaxed strains existing in the first CrN layer contribute to the zb-AlN formation in the first few layers
