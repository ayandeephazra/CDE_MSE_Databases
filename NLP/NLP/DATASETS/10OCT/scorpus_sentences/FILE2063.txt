The elemental parameters were based on the elemental properties from experiments or density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and comprised, inter alia, atomic fundamental properties (e.g., atomic number, period, group in the periodic table), chemical properties (e.g., Pauling electronegativity, Mulliken electronegativity), and physical properties (density, melting temperature, specific heat capacity)
