Starting from the composition of basalt KS-082 (the most primitive melt studied here), we calculate that the trachyte, trachyandesite and rhyolite samples plot on a similar liquid line of decent that evolved along a Ti isotope fractionation α solid−melt of 0.99980 ± 4 (Δ49Tisolid−melt= −0.20 ± 0.04 ‰; average between calculation using K2O and Rb concentrations, 2SD) and that around 26% of Ti is left in the melt at the composition of the trachyte and trachyandesite samples and around 5% of Ti is left in the two rhyolite samples, when compared to the initial amount (Fig. 6)
