A massive number (i.e., >1000) of indents with depths of up to ~6000 nm were made on each of the two sandstones with highly contrasting microstructures and dissimilar compositions, followed by intensive data processing using the recently developed data analytics consisting of data segmentation to extract subdatasets at various depths, statistical deconvolution of each subdataset to identify mechanically distinct phases, re-assembly of results from different subdatasets, and indentation surround effect modeling to extract the properties of both individual phases and bulk rocks
