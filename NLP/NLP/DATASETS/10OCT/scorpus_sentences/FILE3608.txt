Due to the different correlation patterns between Ti isotopic composition and indices of magmatic differentiation (e.g. SiO2 concentration) of various magmatic series (e.g. calc-alkaline, tholeiitic and alkaline; see Deng et al., 2019; Hoare et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2019) it has also been proposed that the Ti isotopic composition of ancient evolved igneous rocks could be used to track their formation mechanism (Aarons et al., 2020)
