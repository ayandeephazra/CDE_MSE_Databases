Often, the temperature variations are never correlated to pressure variations for several reasons: 1) access to the test fluid temperature is not available for several reasons outlined in the paper, therefore, the measured external pipe wall temperature is taken instead and is assumed to be equal to the test fluid inside the pipe, 2) the pipe wall temperature variations are generally significant due to variation in the ambient temperature or wind speed (in the case of exposed pipe), 3) the pipe section may not be restrained from axial movement, 4) tables and calculations of DP/DT are readily available for pure water and often erroneously assumed to be applicable to other test media such as mixtures of water-methanol or water-PG, which are vastly different than pure water, and 5) some pipe sections may be partially exposed to ambient and partially buried
