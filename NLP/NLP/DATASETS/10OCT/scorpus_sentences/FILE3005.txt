By ensuring that rotational energy is similar, the coarse grain system can be compared to the original system.(17)12I′θ̇′2=s312Iθ̇2 The torques on the coarse grains depend on the contact forces and the radius of the particle, and accordingly the torque is now s 4 times higher than the original torque
