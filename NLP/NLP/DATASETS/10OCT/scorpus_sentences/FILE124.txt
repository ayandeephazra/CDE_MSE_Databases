Apart from the obvious differences in the element formulations, there are additional differences between the simulations:•An explicit time integration scheme is used for the CEL simulation whereas an implicit scheme based on the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor method is applied for the Lagrangian calculations.•Without the occurence of cavitation, no void hole can develop below the pile tip during the upwards movement of the pile caused by the rotating unbalances
