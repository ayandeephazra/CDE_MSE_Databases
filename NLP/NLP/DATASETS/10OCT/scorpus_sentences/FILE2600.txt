By combining Eqs. (3) and (4), the transfer matrix can be expressed directly in terms of the pressures and velocities on the two surfaces of the unit layer, i.e.,(5)Te=T11T12T21T22=coskeffdejρeffc0sinkeffdejsinkeffde/ρeffc0coskeffde,where k eff = (1/d e)cos−1 T 11 is a complex wave number, and the complex characteristic impedance can be calculated from the displayed matrix equation Z eff = ρ eff ω/k eff
