This work focussed on the particle upscaling in relation to material behaviour, as well as the effect of particle upscaling on material equipment interactions for tool penetration and sliding regimes.â€¢The particle upscaling relationships have been theoretically derived and tested for two contact models; Hertz-Mindlin (no-slip) with rolling model C and with rolling of the particles restricted
