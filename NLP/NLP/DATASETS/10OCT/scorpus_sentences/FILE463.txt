Based on this analysis, the phase formation mechanisms active during sputter deposition can be discussed: Since crystallization from an amorphous film requires bulk diffusion to be activated, we infer that the formation of MoAlB thin films by magnetron sputtering at substrate temperatures between 450 and 545 Â°C is surface diffusion mediated
