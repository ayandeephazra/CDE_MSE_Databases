When considering Pauling electronegativity, higher electronegativity corresponds to stronger atomic bonding, and therefore higher bulk moduli.(27)G1F∝α1=1Vmm (28)G2F∝α2=1Vmm−2Smix/R (29)B1F∝β1=14169+2Vmm3 (30)B2F∝β2=1366XP12Vmm+4XP12+456214−Vmm2
We address a design problem as finding new kinds of BMG alloys
