The teeth were randomly allocated into four groups (n = 10) according to the restorative material: Negative control – without restoration; Positive control – conventional resin composite (Opallis; FGM) was applied using increments of up to 2.0 mm-thick; Bulk-Regular – bulk-fill resin composite of regular viscosity (Opus Bulk Fill; FGM) was applied using a single increment of 5 mm-thick; and Bulk-Flow – a low-viscosity bulk-fill resin composite (Opus Bulk Fill Flow; FGM) was applied as the first increment with ∼3.5 mm-thick, followed by two final increments of Opallis (∼1.5 mm-thick)
