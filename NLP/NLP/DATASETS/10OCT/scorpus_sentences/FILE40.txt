In Staubach et al. (2020), a hydro-mechanically coupled Coupled-Eulerianâ€“Lagrangian (CEL) method has been proposed by the authors of this work, which is suitable to model vibratory pile driving in water-saturated soil as large deformations as well as the accumulation and dissipation of pore water pressure can be accounted for
