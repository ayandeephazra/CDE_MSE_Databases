Using the derived reflection coefficient and EI, we establish an inversion approach to estimate fluid bulk modulus and porosity from observed seismic data, which involves 1) the estimation of EI from partially stack seismic data, and 2) the extraction of fluid bulk modulus from estimated EI datasets
