Different magmatic thermometers (e.g. δ18O, Ti in zircon, Mn–Mg equilibrium in Fe–Ti oxide pairs or amphibole-plagioclase chemistry) applied to rocks similar to those studied here (Kefalos dacites and Kos rhoylites) show some variability, but overall indicate storage temperatures of ≤800 °C for dacitic magma and between 670 and 750 °C for rhyolitic magma (Bachman et al., 2007; Bachmann, 2010; Bachmann et al., 2012)
