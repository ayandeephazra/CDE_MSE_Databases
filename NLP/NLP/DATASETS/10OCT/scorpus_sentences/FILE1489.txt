The test preparation includes: (1) place the specimen wrapped with heat shrinkable tubing on the bottom plate; (2) install the axial displacement transducer and radial displacement transducer on the specimen (Fig. 2b); (3) seal the confining pressure barrel with sealing ring tightly; (4) increase the confining pressure and the axial pressure with loading velocity of 0.05 MPa/s to 5 MPa and 8 MPa, respectively
