In the present case, we use the balance of linear momentum of the solid phase solved with respect to the solid displacement us, the mass balance of the pore fluid solved with respect to the pore fluid pressure pf, the mass balance of the solid which yields the evolution law of the porosity (nÌ‡) and lastly the balance of linear momentum of the pore fluid used to obtain the Darcy velocity of the pore fluid (wf)
