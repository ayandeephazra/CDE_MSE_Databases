Around 20 ML algorithms available in the WEKA library, including linear ML algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression, elastic net, ridge regression), nonlinear ML algorithms (naive bayes, bayes net, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, locally weighted learning, support vector machines, Gaussian regression, neural network), ensemble ML algorithms (random forest, bagging, stacking), were used evaluated in terms of second-generation features via the cross-validation test [52]
