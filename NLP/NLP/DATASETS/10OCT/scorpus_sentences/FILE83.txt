As for the herein presented simulations of vibratory pile driving both of these criteria are met1 1The vibratory frequency was 25 Hz and the hydraulic conductivity was ≈1.1·10-3 m/s for the herein simulated tests., the authors conducted an investigation on the influence of the relative acceleration previous to the present study which is reported in Staubach and Machacek (2019) and Staubach and Machaček (2019)
