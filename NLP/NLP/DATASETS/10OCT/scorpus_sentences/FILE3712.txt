Assuming that these small differences are real and not due to the analytical uncertainty, we calculate that 25% of the Ti in olivine, 28% in plagioclase and 6% in quartz might be inherited from mineral or melt inclusions, which can be avoided in in situ LA-ICP-MS analyses by avoiding inclusions and excluding anomalously high signals from the integration cycles
