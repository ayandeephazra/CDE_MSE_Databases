We have measured the Ti isotopic fractionation in rocks that quenched equilibrium at different temperatures, and we can compare our measured and calculated mineral-mineral Ti isotopic fractionations with those predicted from ab initio calculations (Wang et al., 2020) and considerations of the coordination chemistry of Ti
