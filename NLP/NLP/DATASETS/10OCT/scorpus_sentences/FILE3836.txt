We therefore argue that the four samples, andesites Kos2E and KS-041 as well as dacites KS14‐05 and KS14‐10, are products of the admixture of a basaltic melt into an evolved (rhyolitic) magma, while trachyandesite and trachytes Kos1J, Kos08-75B, KS-053 and rhyolites KS14‐06 and KS-022 represent products whose compositions mainly resulted from fractional crystallization
