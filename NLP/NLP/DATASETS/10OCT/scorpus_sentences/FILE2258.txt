In this study, PVA hydrogel was produced by freeze-thaw crosslinking method, and its mechanical properties such as viscoelastic and hyperplastic behavior, which cannot be obtained analytically, was investigated with a coupled finite element (FE)-optimization algorithm and stress relaxation experimental data
