Changes in fluid structure are used to rationalize non-intuitive trends in thermophysical properties, such as the opposite trends in density of pure n-alkylbenzenes and n-alkylcyclohexanes as a function of alkyl chain length, minima in bulk modulus as a function of composition, and mixtures whose density does not follow the same trend as their pure components
