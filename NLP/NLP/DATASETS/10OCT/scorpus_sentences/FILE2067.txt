The equation for the average atomic volume (V mm and V mc) was constructed by Wang et al. [47] to predict the bulk modulus, which may affect the GFA, and is given by Eq. (12):(11)fspd=spdVEC/VEC1 (12)Vmmc=∑i=1Nai·43πRmc3where VEC 1 is the average number of valence electrons, as calculated by Eq. (1)
