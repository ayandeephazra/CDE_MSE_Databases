With these roughly estimated crystallization temperatures for the different rocks, i.e. ~1150 °C (basalt), 810 °C (andesite), 770 °C (dacites), 700 °C (rhyolites), we can now estimate the expected Δ49Ti between different mineral pairs based on those predicted from ab initio calculations (see Wang et al., 2020 and section 4) and compare the predictions with our measurements (Fig. 7)
