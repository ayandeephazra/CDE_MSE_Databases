In biotite, the most commonly described substitution mechanism is the exchange of Ti4+ with Fe2+ or Mg2+ in the M(2)-site, and charge balance is either achieved via the loss of two H in the OH-site (Ti-oxy substitution) or the substitution of Al3+ for Si4+ or M-site vacancies (Cesare et al., 2003; Deer et al., 2013)
