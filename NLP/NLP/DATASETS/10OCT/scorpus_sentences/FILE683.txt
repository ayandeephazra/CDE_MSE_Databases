More recently, high-entropy ceramics (HECs), the ceramic counterparts to the metallic HEAs, have been fabricated in the bulk form, including rocksalt [7], perovskite [8], fluorite [9], pyrochlore [10], and spinel [11] oxides, borides [12â€“16], silicides [17,18], carbides [19,20], nitrides [21,22], sulfides [23], and fluorides [24], as well as aluminides (intermetallics) [25]
