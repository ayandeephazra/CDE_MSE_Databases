In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulation with embedded-atom potential to investigate the dependence of the mechanical properties of Cu nanowires of square cross-section, including Young's modulus, yield stress and surface force, on cross-sectional area and temperature for the Cu nanowires with cross-sectional areas in a range of 13.1 to 117.6 nm2 in a temperature range of 100 to 500 K
