The developed as-spun HEMGs exhibit typical paramagnetic properties even for a high amount of ferromagnetic elements (Co, Fe, and Ni) and have high elastic modulus (103–160 GPa) and hardness (14–27 GPa), thus possessing mechanical properties similar to well-known Co-based metallic glasses (Co-Cr-Mo-C-B system)
