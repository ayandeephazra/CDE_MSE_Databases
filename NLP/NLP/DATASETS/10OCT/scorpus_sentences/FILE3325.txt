In addition, the gravimetric hydrogen sorption uptake under isobaric conditions was determined and compared with the structural information based on the previous work by GoÌˆtze et al. At lower pressures we suggest the formation of the MgPd2H0.14 phase at isobaric conditions of p = 2.5 MPa and T > 437 K
