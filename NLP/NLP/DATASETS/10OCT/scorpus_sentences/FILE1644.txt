The new index is statistically correlated to the mechanical brittleness index (BI mer).(3)The new mineralogical brittleness index in equation (6), can be used directly to subsurface conditions as a shale brittleness index, because the mineralogical compositions, specifically, the brittle mineral contents are not influenced by in-situ stress conditions and/or formation temperature.(4)The new mineralogical brittleness index (BI bm) was applied to a case study for its effectiveness in characterizing shale brittleness
