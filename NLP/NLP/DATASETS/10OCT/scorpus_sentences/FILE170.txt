Since using an explicit time integration scheme is a rather unusual choice for the solution of hydro-mechanically coupled problems it is worth mentioning here that other researches have also applied explicit time integration methods for hydro-mechanically coupled problems before (see e.g. Ye et al., 2010; Bandara and Soga, 2015; Navas et al., 2017)
