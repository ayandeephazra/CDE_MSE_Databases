Temperature dependent Young's modulus, shear modulus and the related internal frictions of Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 (Vit-1) bulk metallic glass (BMG) were measured by using the modified piezoelectric ultrasonic composite oscillator technique (M-PUCOT) at longitudinal and torsional resonance under several tens of kilohertz, respectively
