Using relationship between reflection coefficients and scattering function, we derive a linearized PP-wave reflection coefficient as a function of fluid bulk modulus and modified porosity, and we also present the corresponding elastic impedance, which is useful for modeling how fluids affect seismic reflection amplitudes
