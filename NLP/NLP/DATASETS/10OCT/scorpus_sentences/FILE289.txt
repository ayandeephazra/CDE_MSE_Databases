This strong decrease in effective stress alongside the shaft caused by the driving process can explain the general observation that vibratory driven piles have less load capacity once in service compared to impact driven or jacked piles (for simulations of impact driven or jacked piles using the CEL method see Staubach et al., 2020; Staubach et al., 2020)
