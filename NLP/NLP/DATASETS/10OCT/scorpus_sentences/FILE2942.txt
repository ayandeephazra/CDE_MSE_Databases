Furthermore, for application purposes, porous BMG components with pore size of 500 Î¼m were printed by SLM technique, which displayed an interconnected porosity of 70% and extremely low Young's modulus of 13 GPa (being comparable to the human bone tissue), while maintaining a high yield strength of 350 MPa
