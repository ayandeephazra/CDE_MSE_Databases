In the titanomagnetite solid solution series (magnetite – ulvöspinel; Fe3O4 – Fe2TiO4) the average cation-anion bond length in the octahedral site (M-O, with M being Fe and Ti) is around 2.05 Å, but the substitution of Fe with Ti leads to an out-of-center displacement of Ti and a shorter Ti–O than Fe–O bond length in the same mineral (Bosi et al., 2009; Gatta et al., 2014; Lavina et al., 2002)
