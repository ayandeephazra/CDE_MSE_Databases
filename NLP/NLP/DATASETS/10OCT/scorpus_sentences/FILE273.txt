Even though waves with higher frequencies than the one of the driving force travel through the model, their influence is judged negligible, which has been proven for the case of the model tests discussed in Section 2.2. Despite the increased number of elements, the model of the real-scale problem is computationally noticeably more performant compared to the small-scale model used for the back-analysis of the model tests, which is due to the increased critical time increment caused by the larger element size
