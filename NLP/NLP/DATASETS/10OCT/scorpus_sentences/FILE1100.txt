Aluminum nitride (AlN) is a wide-gap optoelectronic material that is of considerable technological interest [2] with many unique properties such as high hardness, high thermal conductivity and existing in a variety of polymorphs, i.e. at room temperature stable hexagonal wurtzite (wz-AlN), metastable cubic zincblende (zb-AlN), and the high-pressure cubic rock-salt variant (rs-AlN)
