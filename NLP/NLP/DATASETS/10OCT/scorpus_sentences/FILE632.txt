Results from indentation showed Pottsville shale sample had overall better sealing properties than Marcellus shale, because of 1) higher bulk mechanical properties: Pottsville have average Young's Modulus of 9.55 and 11.03 Gpa from different directions, the values for Marcellus was 7.48 and 8.96 Gpa, Pottsville also have average hardness of 0.5 and 0.53 Gpa from different directions, the values for Marcellus was 0.24 and 0.31 Gpa; 2) more uniform grain size: from <1 μm to 50 μm for Pottsville, while <1 μm–200 μm for Marcellus; 3) higher rigid grain content: Pottsville has rigid grain content of 10.37% comparing to 4.01% of Marcellus.; and 4) the potential of fracture/deformation healing and re-sealing within few months: deformation on Pottsville almost recovered to its original state (<6% difference), while on Marcellus, the number is 43% of its maximum deformation after four months
