Using the relationship ρ ̄fb-grad(pf)=-grad(Δpf) and expressing the pore fluid pressure rate only in terms of the change relative to the initial state (ṗf=Δṗf), Eq. (4) can be rewritten as follows(6)φfΔṗfK ̅f+KPermηfdiv-grad(Δpf)-KPermηfdivu ̈s+div(u̇s)=0.By (re)interpreting the temperature as the excess pore fluid pressure θ=Δpf, the following three matching terms can be identified from a comparison of Eq. (6) and Eq. (5) (7)cρθ̇=φfΔṗfK ̅f, (8)λdiv-grad(θ)=KPermηfdiv-grad(Δpf), (9)ṁT=div(u̇s)-KPermηfdivu ̈s.Note that Eq. (8) requires the aforementioned assumption of an isotropic permeability of the porous medium
