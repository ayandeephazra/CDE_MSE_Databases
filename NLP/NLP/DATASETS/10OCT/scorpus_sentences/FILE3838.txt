To test if the magma mixing hypothesis can also explain the two trends observed in the bulk rock δ49Ti vs SiO2 space, we performed a binary mixing model calculation between a basaltic (SiO2 = 52 wt%, TiO2 = 0.9 wt%, δ49Ti = 0.04‰) and a rhyolitic magma (SiO2 = 74 wt%, TiO2 = 0.15 wt% and δ49Ti = 0.65‰), compositions that are typical for rocks from the Kos volcano-plutonic system (Fig. 6)
