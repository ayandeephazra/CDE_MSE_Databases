The determined transverse modulus (10.4 GPa) is compared with those experimentally measured by nanoindentation (13.4 GPa), numerically analyzed using 2-D and 3-D FEM models (5.25 GPa and 28.7 GPa, respectively), and theoretically calculated from the Mori–Tanaka, Halpin–Tsai, and Uemura equations (24.8 GPa, 17.4 GPa, and 28.4 GPa, respectively).
