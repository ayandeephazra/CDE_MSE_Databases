In the following, considering the phase transition pressure, we investigate the bulk modulus and its pressure derivatives of the NaCl-type structure of an NaH over a range of pressures from 0 to 32 GPa, and those of the CsCl-type structure over a range of pressures from 33 to 65 GPa through the quasi-harmonic Debye model. High-pressure X-ray diffraction data on an NaH to 54 GPa at room temperature show the isothermal bulk modulus B0 with an NaCl-type structure is 19.40±2.00 GPa, with a pressure derivative B0′ of 4.40±0.50.

The structural parameters (the lattice parameters and bulk modulus) are in good agreement with the previous experimental data. Our results for the elastic constants up to 70 GPa satisfy the traditional mechanical stability conditions for ZnSnP2 compound.

On the other hand, He et al. have, using first–principles calculations within the density functional theory, shown that the five polymorphs of C3N4, i.e. cs-, p-, α-, β- and c- C3N4 have bulk moduli 379.2, 393.2, 378.7, 419.1 and 449.2 GPa respectively with corresponding hardness (Vickers) of 62.3, 79.6, 82.7, 85.7, and 92.0 GPa respectively.

The elastic moduli of Au were obtained at five pressure points between 0 and 20 GPa. The pressure variation of the bulk modulus displays anomalous behavior, being nearly constant up to ~5 GPa, and then steeply increasing at higher pressure. A similar anomaly is observed in first-principles calculations. An absolute pressure scale was derived by direct numerical integration of the bulk modulus over volume change. This yields a scale that gives slightly lower pressure values than those of previous work, about 5–10% lower at ~20 GPa.

By fitting the pressure-volume data up to 58 GPa, the bulk modulus of Os and its pressure derivative are determined to be B0=395(15)GPa and B′0=4.5(5).

In situ synchrotron X-ray observations indicate that Ni3–xS forms above 5.1 GPa and melts incongruently into Ni+liquid up to 10 GPa. The bulk modulus of Ni3–xS at 300 K was determined to be 140 ± 2 GPa with a fixed K′ = 4 by static compression with a liquid pressure medium. The eutectic point of the Ni-NiS system lies between Ni3S and Ni3S2 up to 10 GPa and its composition changes from Ni66.6S33.4 at 0.1 MPa to Ni70.7S29.3 at 10 GPa. The eutectic melting temperature of the Ni-NiS system decreases to 5.1 GPa and 720 K as the pressure increases where Ni and α-Ni3S2 are the eutectic solids. On the other hand, the eutectic melting temperature increases with a positive slope above 5.1 GPa where Ni3S+α-Ni3S2 is stable under subsolidus conditions.

For γ-Fe2O3 the bulk modulus has been found to increase from 203 GPa for the bulk material to 305 GPa for 9 nm size crystals.

The experimental values for the zero-pressure bulk modulus of CeO2 and PrO2 are 220(9) and 187(8) GPa, respectively. Our calculations reproduce the lattice constants with good accuracy, but find identical bulk modulii for CeO2 (176.9 GPa) and PrO2 (176.8 GPa).

The bulk modulus of an individual C60 molecule is calculated in terms of the C,C bond force constant. A range of values for the bulk modulus is obtained with literature values for the force constant. The values obtained all exceed the bulk modulus (441 GPa) of diamond. With a C,C bond force constant equal to that between adjacent carbon atoms in graphite, 7.08 mdyn/Å, a bulk modulus of 903 GPa is obtained.

On the basis of a simple composite model it is calculated that single closest‐packed C60 crystals of C60 will have a bulk modulus of roughly 668 GPa under hydrostatic pressures.

Using the first-order Bridgman equation and the Birch equation of state, the isothermal bulk modulus (B0) of nanocrystalline γ-alumina utilizing a diamond anvil cell (DAC) and the energy dispersive X-ray diffraction method was determined to be 162 ± 14 GPa and Young's modulus (E) was estimated to be 253 ± 22 GPa assuming a Poisson's ratio for γ-alumina of 0.24 ± 0.2.
