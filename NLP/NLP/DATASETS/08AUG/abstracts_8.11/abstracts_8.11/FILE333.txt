Elementary content of the crystals was tested using electron probe microanalysis, phase composition and unit cell parameters were studied using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), morphology of the cleavage plane and layered structure of a cross section normal to the growth axis were studied using light microscopy, morphology of impression under an indenter tip was imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)
