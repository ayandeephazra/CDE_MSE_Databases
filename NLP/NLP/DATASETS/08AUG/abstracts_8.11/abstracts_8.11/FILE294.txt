In addition, the elastic anisotropy of m-BN in the anisotropy of the bulk modulus along the a -axis A Ba and A 1 and A 3 (shear anisotropic factors) increases with increasing pressure, while the anisotropy of m-BN in the bulk modulus along the a -axis A Ba and A 2 (shear anisotropic factor) decreases with increasing pressure.
