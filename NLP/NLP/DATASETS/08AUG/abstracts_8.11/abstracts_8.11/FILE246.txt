Pressure-dependent elastic stiffness coefficients ( C i j ) , bulk modulus ( B ) , shear modulus ( G ) , Young modulus ( E ) , Poisson's ratio ( σ ) , B / G ratio and Zener anisotropy factor ( A ) have been calculated at 0, 10, 18 GPa pressures for DC phase and at 20, 25, 30 GPa pressures for DR phases
