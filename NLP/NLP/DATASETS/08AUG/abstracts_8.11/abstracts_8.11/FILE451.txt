The probabilities of the creation of two and three e–h pairs under the absorption of a single photon in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) were investigated in the second and in the third orders of the perturbation theory using as the perturbations the Hamiltonians of the electron–radiation and electron–electron Coulomb interactions
