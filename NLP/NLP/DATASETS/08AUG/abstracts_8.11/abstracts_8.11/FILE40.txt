The optimized lattice parameters, independent elastic constants (C11, C12, C13, C33, C44 and C66), bulk modulus B, compressibility K, shear modulus G, and Poisson's ratio Î½, as well as the band structures, total and atom projected densities of states and finally the optical properties of HgGeB2 have been evaluated and discussed
