Capacitance-voltage-temperature (C–V-T) and conductance-voltage-temperature (G/ω-V-T) measurements of an Au/(0.07 Zn-doped polyvinyl alcohol)/n-4H–SiC metal-polymer-semiconductor structure were obtained to study the effect of temperature and voltage on dielectric characteristics such as the dielectric constant (ϵ′, ϵ″), loss tangent (tan δ), electric modulus, and ac conductivity
