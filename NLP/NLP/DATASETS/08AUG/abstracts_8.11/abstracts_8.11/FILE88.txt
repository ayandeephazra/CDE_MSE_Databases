Furthermore, correlating the impedance and modulus spectra reveals the localized charge carrier relaxation in this triple cation device from which we obtain a phenomenological picture of the hopping process and developing an understanding of the charge carrier kinetics in these high-efficiency perovskite photovoltaics.
