Using the full potential Linearized augmented Plane Wave (FP-LAPW) method to the density functional theory (DFT) as part of the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), we investigated the structural, electronic, elastic, thermodynamic, and thermoelectric properties of ternary XHfGe (X = Ni and Pd) Half-Heusler alloys
