We have performed comprehensive DFT-based ab initio calculations of the structural parameters, elastic constants and related properties, electronic structures and optical constants of new quaternary diamond-like compounds, Li2HgMS4 (M = Si, Ge and Sn), which are novel promising infrared nonlinear optical materials
