The calculations are based on the pseudopotential formalism in which local potential coupled with the virtual crystal approximation (VCA) is applied to evaluate elastic constants c 11, c 12 and c 44, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for the entire range of the alloy composition x of the ternary alloy Ga x In1âˆ’x P
