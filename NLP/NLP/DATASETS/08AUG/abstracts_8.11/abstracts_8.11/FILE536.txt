This study reported the structural properties, stability, mechanical anisotropy properties (anisotropy in Poisson's ratio, shear modulus, Young's modulus, and the universal elastic anisotropy index) and electronic properties (electronic band structure) of Si20- x Ge x , Ge20- x Sn x , and Si20- x Sn x alloy (x = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20) in the P41212 phase
