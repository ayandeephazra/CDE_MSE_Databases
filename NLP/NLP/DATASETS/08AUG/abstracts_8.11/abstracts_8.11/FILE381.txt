On the other hand, the dielectric permittivities, dissipation factor, AC electrical conductivity, modulus, and impedance components were determined based on the capacitance-temperature (C m -T), capacitance-frequency (C m- ω ), conductance-temperature (G m -T), and conductance-frequency (G m - ω ) measurements
