The lattice constants, phase transition, elastic, dielectric and dynamic properties of wide band gaps CdSxTe1âˆ’x semiconductors have been studied within ab initio pseudopotential method based on the density functional theory (DFT) using the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
