In this paper we report about the in-situ experiments on cobalt titanate (CoTiO3), in which were investigated the compressibility at high pressures up to 24.6 GPa, at room temperature, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) and also the thermal expansion at high temperatures, from 298 to 723 K, using a conventional diffractometer at atmospheric pressure
