Correlations between the energy gap, optical electronegativity and bulk modulus are given for compound and ternary chalcopyrite semiconductors.
Bulk modulus and electronic polarizability values have been evaluated from the optical electronegativity.
The estimated values of these parameters are in good agreement with the available experimental data.
