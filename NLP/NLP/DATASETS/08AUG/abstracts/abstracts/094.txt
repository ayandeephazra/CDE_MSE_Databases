Based on the complex crystal chemical bond theory, the formula of Liu and Cohen's, which is only suitable for one type of bond, has been extended to calculate the bulk modulus of ternary chalcopyrite A I B III C2 VI and A II B IV C2 V which contains two types of bonds.
The calculated results are in fair agreement with the previous theoretical values reported and experimental values.
