An application study of the bulk modulus as a function of hydrostatic pressure for CdS, CdSe, and CdTe has been presented.
This factor has been calculated by means of our recent model.
The structural phase transition can be seen easily from behaviour of the bonding character.
The results are compared with the theoretical and experimental data and are in reasonable agreement.
