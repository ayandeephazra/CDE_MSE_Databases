A correlation is established between the bulk modulus and inter-atomic spacing of group-IV semiconductors involving their bond energy.
Universal parameter tight binding approach is employed in evaluating the bond energy of the systems.
In case of alloys, Vegard's law is utilised to calculate the lattice constants from which average inter-atomic spacings are obtained.
Results are in good agreement with the experimental and reported values.
